# SpotiStuff

A collection of stuff I did with [Spotify Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/#/). For Spotify authentication, it uses [Implicit Grant Flow](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization/implicit-grant/). The application is made mostly with [Material UI](https://mui.com/) components. This is also my first actual React project ðŸ‘¶

- **SpotiDiff**: Compare your playlists to some other user's based on track IDs.
- **SpotiFind**: See if you have added a song to any one of your playlists.
- **SpotiPeek**: Get audio features for the song that you are currently playing.

UI design (to be) made in [Penpot](https://penpot.app/).

## ToDos

- Penpot design
- Better error handling (with components). Also check status code of requests.
- Implement tests
