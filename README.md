# SpotiStuff

A collection of mini-tools made with [Spotify Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/#/) and MantineUI. Authentication is made using [Implicit Grant Flow](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization/implicit-grant/).

- **SpotiFind** searches a track in a user's playlists.
- **SpotiPeek** shows you the audio features of your currently playing track.
- **SpotiDiff** compares your playlists to another user's playlists.

## Todo:

- Make spotify API a singleton, do not pass the token each time (obviously).
- More documentation to be provided.
- Responsive design retouch needed.
