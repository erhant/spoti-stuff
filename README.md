# SpotiStuff

A collection of stuff I did with [Spotify web API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/#/). For Spotify authentication, it uses [Implicit Grant Flow](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization/implicit-grant/). The application is made mostly with [Material UI](https://mui.com/) components.

- **SpotiSync**: Synchronize multiple accounts to play together.
- **SpotiFind**: See if you have added a song to any one of your playlists.
- **SpotiPeek**: Simply see which song you are currently playing.

## ToDos

- Retrieve song link from textfield
- Implement SpotiFind
- Do one more module, to display track audio features.
- Retrieve authentication token from session storage (respect expiration time too)
- Better error handling
