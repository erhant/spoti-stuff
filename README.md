# SpotiStuff

A collection of stuff I did with Spotify web API.

- **SpotiSync**: Synchronize multiple accounts to play together.
- **SpotiFind**: See if you have added a song to any one of your playlists.
- **SpotiPeek**: Simply see which song you are currently playing.

Uses [Material UI](https://mui.com/) components.
