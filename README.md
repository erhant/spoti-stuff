# spoti-stuff

A collection of stuff I did with Spotify web API.

- **SpotiSync**: Synchronize multiple accounts to play together.
- **SpotiFind**: See if you have added a song to any one of your playlists.

Uses [Material UI](https://mui.com/) components.

Followed this [guide](https://blog.jarrodwatts.com/nextjs-eslint-prettier-husky) for formatting.
